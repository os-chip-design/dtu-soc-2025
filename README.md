# The SoC for the chip design course 2025

We will build a RISC-V SoC targeting the ChipIgnite project from efabless.

This README shall be the starting point for the documentation.

## Tasks

 * RISC-V CPU (Wildcat)
 * Cache
 * ... to be written and decided

## Setup

### Checking out the repository

- Be sure to initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive` or by cloning with `git clone --recurse-submodules`

## Repository structure

- [Wildcat CPU](https://github.com/schoeberl/wildcat) in external/wildcat
