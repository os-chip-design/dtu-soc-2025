# The SoC for the chip design course 2025

We will build a RISC-V SoC targeting the ChipIgnite project from efabless.

This README shall be the starting point for the documentation.

## Task distribution

The main tasks are the task you are responisble for and that you are expected to lead and complete. The secondary tasks are the tasks for which you are expected to monitor the progress and give help. Every group needs to deal with verification and the chip design toolchain.
